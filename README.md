# Introduction

**ebi-metagenomics/datascout** is a pipeline to query and fetch protein, RNA and transcriptomic evidence to support eukaryotic gene annotation, from different data archives: European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), Rfam, UniProt and OrthoDB

The pipeline allows for bespoke requests such as specificity of taxonomic rank queried, evidence levels and volume of outputs.


> [!NOTE]
> This pipeline uses the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re) template with some tweaks, but it's not part of nf-core.

# Pipeline steps

The datascout pipeline is split into the following steps:

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/datascout_whitebg.png" alt="ebi-metagenomics/datascout pipeline diagram">
</p>

## Step 1. Construct taxonomic lineage

Uses NCBI taxdump to construct taxonomic lineages using [ete toolkit](https://github.com/etetoolkit/ete), ignoring any ranks labelled as "no rank"

## Step 2. OrthoDB

Query OrthoDB for clusters matching the most specific possible taxid OR the given rank in the samplesheet.
Creates a combined protein fasta file for a cluster.

Uses the following filters:
"universal": "0.9",
"singlecopy": "0.9"

An optional `orthodb_min_proteins` parameter can be used to force the pipeline to discard genomes with fewer than `orthodb_min_proteins` proteins. This is useful because downstream pipelines, such as the MGnify Genomes Catalogue Pipeline, cannot process genomes with insufficient gene evidence. This is because BRAKER, for example, runs AUGUSTUS, which crashes when the protein evidence file contains too little information to train the model used for predictions ([details in this issue](https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER/issues/8)).

## Step 3. UniProt

Query UniProt for proteins matching the most specific possible taxid OR the given rank in the samplesheet.
Created a protein fasta file with simplifed headers.

Uses user provides filters:
Evidence level 1 = Experimental evidence at protein level
Evidence level 2 = Experimental evidence at transcript level OR above
Evidence level 3 = Protein inferred from homology OR above

Results are filtered for swissprot only entries if the the input flag is used.

## Step 4 (optional). Rfam

Query Rfam for models matching the most specific possible taxid OR the given rank in the samplesheet.
Outputs a list of Rfams.

This step uses the [credentials](assets/rfam_db.conf) for the public Rfam database

This step can be disabled with `--skip_rfam`, in which case no Rfam query is performed and no `rfam_dir` output is produced.

## Step 5. ENA and transcriptomes

This step groups values in samplesheet data by genome_id and ena_tax to avoid download duplicate sets of reads for the same genome.
Per grouping it queries ENA for transcriptomic reads matching the most specific possible taxid OR the given rank (ena_tax) in the samplesheet.

The results are reordered with the following critera to try and download the most diverse set of reads possible (i.e. not all reads from the same sample/study):
- Check data is paired and with two files
- filter short sequences read length <75
- sort by descending base count
- group by sample name and cycle through alternating the names

Downloads fastq files for the used specified number of max runs and uncompresses the files

## Step 6 (optional). Sourmash subworkflow

Check containment of the downloaded reads in the genome (both sketches).
Filter only runs which contribute >= 1% unique kmers mapped to the genome in the output.

                          information about the samples and genomes.
                          You will need to create this before running the pipeline.

  --download_rna_fastq    Enable transcriptomic FASTQ download and publishing.
                          Used only when --sourmash is false. Ignored when
                          --sourmash is true. [default: true]
  --max_orthodb_clusters <int> Maximum number of clusters to download from orthodb.

  --sourmash              Enable sourmash filtering.
                          Uses sourmash for sequence similarity filtering instead of

  --skip_rfam             Skip the Rfam accessions retrieval step.
                          When enabled, the pipeline will not query Rfam and no
